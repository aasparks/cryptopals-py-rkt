  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <p>This page contains the documentation for the solutions in both languages.
  This seemed as good a time as any to learn how to officially document in
  both. This page contains the links to both.</p>

  <p>The Python documentation was created by Sphinx, which uses ReST. It was
  a massive pain to learn, but very powerful and useful once you get past the
  learning curve.</p>

  <p>The Racket documentation is done with scribble. This isn't my first time
  using it, so it was pretty easy.</p>
